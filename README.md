# ALLIN
ALLIN - (Annotation of sequence aLignment and structuraL ProteIn visualizatioN) is a web interface to generate an interactive HTML web page for the simultaneously visualization of annotated protein sequences alignment and 3D structures or homology models of the related proteins. 

The physiological, functional, and structural properties of proteins and their pathogenic variants can be summarized using many tools. The amount of information relating to a single protein is quite large and often widespread in many documents and requires different programs access. It is not always easy or immediate to select, simultaneously visualize, and compare specific properties. On the other hand, the comparison of data from proteins belonging to the same protein family could suggest possible conserved properties or spotlight significant differences. We developed a web interface, called ALLIN (Annotation of Sequence ALignment and structuraL ProteIn visualizatioN) to generate a web page for the simultaneous visualization of a multi-sequence protein alignment, including comments and annotations, and the related three-dimensional protein structures or homology models. 
The distinctive feature of this web interface is that it permits the inclusion of comments and colored residues in the alignment section, in accordance with the color code specified by the properties being compared, in a simple way that does not require training or coding expertise. The final result is a unique “memo” web page that compares available data from different sources, with the flexibility to highlight only the information of interest, providing a general overview of the state of art of a protein family. New data can be conveniently added as it emerges.
